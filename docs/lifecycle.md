# Lifecycle

Lifecycle subcommands provide post-dispatch introspection and management. They read control records and artifact directories created during dispatch — no running process required.

All lifecycle subcommands output human-readable tables by default. Pass `--json` for structured JSON output. Errors follow the standard envelope: `{"kind":"error","error":{...}}`.

## List

```bash
agent-mux list [--limit N] [--status completed|failed|timed_out] [--engine codex|claude|gemini] [--json]
```

Lists recent dispatches. Default limit is 20 (pass 0 for all).

Output columns: ID (12-character prefix), SALT, STATUS, ENGINE, MODEL, DURATION, CWD.

With `--json`, emits NDJSON (one record per line).

Example — show the last 5 failed Codex dispatches:

```bash
agent-mux list --limit 5 --status failed --engine codex
```

## Status

```bash
agent-mux status [--json] <dispatch_id>
```

Shows status for a single dispatch. Accepts full ID or unique prefix.

Fields shown: Status, Engine/Model, Duration, Started, Truncated, Salt, ArtifactDir.

For running dispatches, reads live `status.json` from the artifact directory. Detects orphaned processes where the host PID is dead but the dispatch was never marked terminal.

Example:

```bash
agent-mux status 01JA
```

## Result

```bash
agent-mux result [--json] [--artifacts] [--no-wait] <dispatch_id>
```

Retrieves the dispatch response. Accepts full ID or unique prefix.

Default behavior: prints the stored result text. Falls back to `full_output.md` in the artifact directory for truncated or legacy dispatches.

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--artifacts` | Lists files in the artifact directory instead of printing the response |
| `--no-wait` | Returns an error if the dispatch is still running instead of blocking |
| `--json` | Structured JSON output |

If the dispatch is still running, blocks until completion by default.

Example — list artifacts:

```bash
agent-mux result --artifacts 01JARQ8X
```

## Inspect

```bash
agent-mux inspect [--json] <dispatch_id>
```

Deep view of a dispatch. Accepts full ID or unique prefix.

Shows all record fields: ID, Status, Engine, Model, Role, Variant, Started, Ended, Duration, Truncated, Salt, Cwd, ArtifactDir. Also includes artifact listing and full response text.

JSON mode adds `meta` from `dispatch_meta.json` when present.

Example:

```bash
agent-mux inspect 01JARQ8X
```

## Garbage Collection

```bash
agent-mux gc --older-than <duration> [--dry-run]
```

`--older-than` is required. Duration format: `Nd` (days) or `Nh` (hours).

Cleans: JSONL records, result files, and artifact directories. Records with unparseable timestamps are always kept.

`--dry-run` shows what would be deleted without deleting anything.

Example — dry run, dispatches older than 7 days:

```bash
agent-mux gc --older-than 7d --dry-run
```
