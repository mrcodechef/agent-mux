  Use for: async dispatch, result collection, mid-flight steering, spawning
  workers, running pipelines, recovering timed-out dispatches, parsing output
  contracts, and multi-model coordination.

# agent-mux

Dispatch substrate. One CLI, one JSON contract, three engines. TOML-driven
roles encode engine + model + effort + timeout + skills into one flag. The
calling LLM decides what to do — agent-mux handles the how.

## Design Principles

These are load-bearing. They explain why things work the way they do.

**Tool, not orchestrator.** agent-mux resolves inputs and dispatches. It does
not decide strategy. Multi-step behavior lives in TOML-defined pipelines.

**Job done is holy.** Artifact directories and dispatch metadata exist before
the harness starts. Partial work is preserved across timeout, crash, or cancel.

**Errors are steering signals.** Every failure carries a code, message,
suggestion, and retryability flag. Parse them programmatically, not as text.

**Single-shot with curated context.** The default path is one spec into one
engine. Fan-out only happens through pipelines. Front-load context; don't
make the worker discover its own scope.

## Quickstart

### Discovery
```bash
agent-mux config roles        # role catalog: engines, models, timeouts, variants
agent-mux config pipelines    # named multi-step workflows
```

### Dispatch -> Check -> Collect

`--async` returns instantly. Read the ack, check progress, collect when done.

```bash
# DISPATCH — instant ack with dispatch_id
agent-mux -R=scout --async -C=/repo "Find all deprecated API usages" 2>/dev/null
# -> {"kind":"async_started","dispatch_id":"01KMY...","salt":"fair-elk-one","artifact_dir":"/tmp/agent-mux/01KMY..."}

# CHECK — while the worker is running
agent-mux inspect <id> 2>/dev/null           # metadata: role, engine, duration
agent-mux steer <id> status 2>/dev/null      # liveness: running / orphaned / done

# COLLECT — blocks until done, single clean JSON
agent-mux result <id> --json 2>/dev/null
# -> {"status":"completed","response":"...","activity":{"files_changed":[...]}}
```

Result: check `status`, `response`, `response_truncated`, `activity.files_changed`.

### Parallel dispatch

Multiple `--async` in one Bash call — each returns its own ack:
```bash
agent-mux -R=scout --async -C=/repo "Scan auth module" 2>/dev/null
agent-mux -R=scout --async -C=/repo "Scan API layer" 2>/dev/null
agent-mux -R=scout --async -C=/repo "Scan DB layer" 2>/dev/null
```
Collect each by ID: `agent-mux result <id> --json`.

### Structured spec (when CLI flags aren't enough)
```bash
cat > /tmp/spec.json << 'EOF'
{"role":"lifter","prompt":"...","cwd":"/repo","sandbox":"none","context_file":"/tmp/prior-analysis.md"}
EOF
agent-mux --stdin --async < /tmp/spec.json 2>/dev/null
```

**Codex workers:** Use `--sandbox none` for reliable file output. `workspace-write` has known persistence issues with multi-file writes.

### Steer mid-flight
```bash
agent-mux steer <id> redirect "Narrow to parser module only" 2>/dev/null
agent-mux steer <id> nudge 2>/dev/null         # gentle reminder
agent-mux steer <id> extend 300 2>/dev/null    # add 5 min
agent-mux steer <id> abort 2>/dev/null          # kill
```

### Wait (block until completion)
```bash
agent-mux wait <id> --poll 60 2>/dev/null
```
Poll interval: CLI `--poll` > config `[async].poll_interval` > 60s default.

## Engine Cognitive Styles

**Claude** resolves ambiguity. Planning, synthesis, review, prompt crafting.
Roles: `architect`, `researcher`. Watch for: skipping validation, over-abstraction.

**Codex** executes precision. Implementation, debugging, focused audits. Needs
surgical scope — one goal, specific files, explicit gate. Roles: `lifter`,
`auditor`, `scout`. Watch for: paralysis on underspecified prompts.
**Sandbox note:** Use `--sandbox none` for reliable multi-file output. The
`workspace-write` sandbox has known file persistence issues when workers write
multiple files. Restrict scope with `--cwd` instead.

**Gemini** provides contrast. Different training, different blind spots. Use as
second opinion or challenge probe. All variants are reasoning-only on this
machine — no file reads, no tool calls. All context must be in the prompt.

**Streaming v2:** stderr is silent by default — only bookend events
(`dispatch_start`, `dispatch_end`) and failures are emitted. Use `--stream`
to restore full event output for human debugging.

**Meta-rule:** exploration -> Claude, precision -> Codex. Don't cross the streams.

## Dispatch Patterns

1. **`-R=role`** — CLI shorthand, most common for simple dispatches.
   ```bash
   agent-mux -R=lifter --async -C=/repo "Implement retries in client.ts"
   ```

2. **`--stdin` JSON** — structured specs with multiple overrides, recovery
   context, programmatic construction.
   ```bash
   printf '{"role":"lifter","prompt":"...","cwd":"/repo"}' | agent-mux --stdin --async
   ```

3. **Raw flags** (`-E= -m=`) — escape hatch when no role fits.
   ```bash
   agent-mux -E=codex -m=gpt-5.4 -e=high --async -C=/repo "one-off task"
   ```

4. **`-P=pipeline`** — multi-step workflows defined in TOML config.
   ```bash
   agent-mux -P=build -C=/repo "Redesign the auth flow"
   ```

## Role Quick-Reference

**Scanning:** `scout` (fast, mini) | `explorer` (deep, multi-file, KB-aware)
**Implementation:** `lifter` (standard) | `lifter-deep` (xhigh, hard problems)
**Cheap parallel:** `grunt` (mini) | `batch` (mini, high-volume)
**Research:** `researcher` (Claude, external) | `explorer` (Codex, internal KB)
**Architecture:** `architect` (Claude, strategic reasoning)
**Verification:** `auditor` (Codex xhigh, adversarial review)
**Writing:** `writer` (Codex, voice-matched, full publishing pipeline)
**Specialized:** `handoff-extractor` (session handoff extraction)

Variants swap the engine within a role: `-R=lifter --variant=claude`. Common
variants: `claude`, `gemini`, `mini`, `spark`. Run `agent-mux config roles`
for the live catalog with all engines, models, timeouts, and variants.

## Output Parsing

**Single dispatch** — 4 fields to check:
- `status`: `completed` | `timed_out` | `failed`. Never treat non-completed as done.
- `response`: The worker's answer. Check it's non-empty and not a placeholder.
- `response_truncated` + `full_output_path`: If truncated, read the full file.
- `activity.files_changed`: What the worker actually modified.

**Pipeline** returns `PipelineResult`, NOT `DispatchResult`:
- `status`: `completed` | `partial` | `failed`
- `steps[]`: Per-step worker results with `summary` and `artifact_dir`
- `final_step`: The last step's output

Always parse JSON from stdout. Never parse as text. `result --json` gives
clean single JSON. For full schemas:
[references/output-contract.md](references/output-contract.md).

## Failure & Recovery

```
status?
 timed_out + files_changed non-empty
   -> --recover=<dispatch_id> with continuation prompt (the delta, not re-brief)
 timed_out + files_changed empty
   -> Prompt too broad. Reframe with tighter scope. Retry ONCE.
 timed_out + heartbeat_count == 0
   -> Worker never started. Config error. Check and retry once.
 failed + error.retryable
   -> Fix cause (wrong flag, missing --network). Retry ONCE.
 failed + not retryable
   -> Structural. Escalate.
 Second failure on same step
   -> STOP. Problem is the prompt or the scope, not the effort level.
      Reframe entirely or escalate.
```

## Codex Prompt Discipline

Codex output quality is a direct function of prompt specificity. Rules:

1. **Exact file paths.** Never "explore src/". If unknown, scout first.
2. **Inline critical context.** The function, the type, the error — not "read file X".
3. **One deliverable.** "Write X to Y" or "modify Z in W". Not "audit and fix."
4. **Word budget.** "3-sentence summary" or "file path + verdict only."
5. **State the verification gate.** How the worker proves it's done.
6. **Use `--context-file` for bulk.** Don't inline giant specs into the prompt.
7. **Pass `--network`/`-n` for web access.** Codex sandbox is offline by default.

BAD: `"Read all files in src/auth/ and identify issues"`
GOOD: `"In src/auth/middleware.go:45-80, validateToken() doesn't handle expired
refresh tokens. Add a check at line 67. refreshToken is at src/auth/refresh.go:12-30."`

## Timeout Alignment

Wrapper timeout MUST exceed agent-mux timeout by at least 60 seconds.

| Effort | agent-mux timeout | Wrapper minimum |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `low` | 120s | 180s (180000ms) |
| `medium` | 600s | 660s (660000ms) |
| `high` | 1800s | 1860s (1860000ms) |
| `xhigh` | 2700s | 2760s (2760000ms) |

Roles set their own timeouts. Check with `agent-mux config roles`.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Raw engine/model/effort when a role fits.** Roles exist. Use them.
- **Exploration prompts to Codex.** Use Claude for open-ended work.
- **Codex with `workspace-write` sandbox for multi-file output.** Use
  `--sandbox none` + `--cwd` for scope control instead.
- **Wrapper timeout == worker timeout.** Add 60s slack.
- **Ignoring `status` field.** `timed_out` is not `completed`.
- **Pipeline output parsed as DispatchResult.** Different JSON shape.
- **Synchronous dispatch from Claude Code coordinators.** Use `--async`.
