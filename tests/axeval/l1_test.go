//go:build axeval

// L1 · Error Self-Correction
//
// Test question: "Agent, you just got this error response. Fix your invocation."
//
// Implementation:
// 1. For each error code in the ErrorCatalog: construct a realistic scenario.
// 2. Give the agent the error response (with code, message, hint, example) + the original failed command.
// 3. Prompt: "You ran this command and got this error. Write the corrected command."
// 4. LLM judge checks: is the corrected command valid? Would it avoid the original error?
//
// Key metric: first-attempt self-correction rate.
// This directly measures: do our AX-quality hint+example fields actually work?
