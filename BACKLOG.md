## Strategic Direction

*Added 2026-03-30*

### Engine Priority Order
1. **Codex** — current focus. Perfect the dispatch, ax-eval coverage, steering, all rough edges. The bar must be top-notch before moving on.
2. **Gemini** — next engine after Codex reaches quality gate.
3. **Other harnesses** — after Gemini parity.

### Post-Freeze Plan
After this cleanup session, agent-mux enters a **multi-week development freeze**. No new features, no polish.

First post-freeze activity (1-2 weeks out): **Dissect the Codex CLI SDK (TypeScript)** end-to-end. Goal: hunt for patterns, undocumented capabilities, and integration points that agent-mux could leverage. Deep reading, not building.

### Current Posture
Codex-first. Ship quality. Resist the infinite polish trap.

## P0 — Next Up

### B-5: Config path resolution bug (`--cwd` doesn't pick up fixture config) — FIXED
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** fixed — session `coordinator` (2026-03-30)
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-03-30)

`--cwd fixture/` doesn't pick up `.agent-mux/config.toml` from the fixture
directory. Config path resolution is anchored to the process working directory
rather than the `--cwd` value, so role/variant resolution silently falls back
to defaults (or fails) whenever a dispatch uses `--cwd` with a fixture that
has its own config.

**Root cause (dual):** (1) `configPaths()` did not absolutize relative `--cwd`
values before joining with `.agent-mux/config.toml`, so relative paths resolved
against process CWD. (2) The ax-eval `testdata/fixture/` seed directory was
missing the `.agent-mux/` config dir — `SetupFixtureDir()` copies testdata to a
temp dir, so the config was never present in test runs.

**Fix:** Absolutize cwd in `configPaths()` + copy `.agent-mux/` to `testdata/fixture/`.

---

### B-6: `host.pid` / `status.json` write-before-ack race — FIXED
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** fixed — session `coordinator` (2026-03-30)
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-03-30)

After `--async` emits its ack JSON to stdout, `host.pid` and `status.json`
are not yet written to disk. Consumers that immediately check the filesystem
after receiving the ack find nothing — no PID file, no status file.

**Root cause:** Both `os.WriteFile` (host.pid) and `WriteStatusJSON` (atomic
rename) did not fsync before proceeding. The write ordering was already correct
(files before ack), but OS buffering meant consumers could see the ack before
the files were durable on disk.

**Fix:** Added explicit `f.Sync()` to both `WriteStatusJSON` and `writeAndSync`
(new helper for host.pid). The ack is now guaranteed to follow durable writes.

---

### B-7: `result --json` missing terminal status field — FIXED
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** fixed — session `coordinator` (2026-03-30)
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-03-30)

`agent-mux result --json` output does not include a terminal status field
indicating whether the dispatch completed successfully, failed, or was killed.
Machine consumers (GSD agents, scripts) cannot distinguish outcomes without
parsing free-form log text.

**Fix:** Added `enrichResultStatus()` to both `runResultCommand` and `showResult`.
Derives `"status"` from store record > dispatch meta > status.json (priority
order). Adds `"kill_reason"` (frozen_killed, signal_killed, oom_killed,
startup_failed) for failed dispatches by scanning events.jsonl. Removed the
`t.Skip` workaround in `TestAsyncDispatchAndCollect`.

---

### S-4: 3 weak-assertion ax-eval cases
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** partially resolved
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-03-30)

Three ax-eval cases have inadequate assertions:

1. **`handoff-summary-extraction`** — scored 1.0 in latest run (2026-03-30).
   `handoff_summary` field is now present in the output contract and
   correctly extracted. **Likely resolved.**

2. **`variant-resolution`** — was 0.5, blocked by B-5 (config path
   resolution). B-5 is now fixed. **Needs re-run** — expect score to improve
   post-fix. Assertions still check stderr events for model confirmation; may
   need hardening if `--stream` is not active during tests.

3. **`response-truncation`** — skipped. The assertion direction is inverted:
   the case checks `truncation=true` but truncation is disabled by design.
   **Fix needed: invert the assertion** to confirm truncation does NOT occur.
   Not a bug fix — assertion logic must be corrected.

**Target:** all three cases at score ≥ 0.7 after fixes.

### F-6: Soft steering via stdin before hard kill — SHIPPED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** shipped — commit `2fd7fda`, session `acabe588`
**Location:** `internal/engine/loop.go` (watchdog), adapters
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

Current liveness: warn at 90s (pure observation), hard kill at 180s. The 90s
gap is dead air — no steering attempt. This was the original design intent of
the LoopEngine architecture, but **stdin pipe was never implemented** — no
`StdinPipe`, no `io.Writer`, no `Write` call to the child process exists
anywhere in `loop.go` or adapters.

The current "recovery" path is inbox-based: write a file → watchdog polls →
kill and relaunch with `ResumeArgs`. This is restart, not steering.

**Implementation needed:**
1. Add `cmd.StdinPipe()` in `startRun` (`loop.go:322-352`)
2. At warn threshold (90s), write nudge to stdin
3. Codex-first: `"\n"` or continuation prompt (stdin-driven by design)
4. Claude/Gemini: lower feasibility, investigate later

**Observed impact:** GSD session `a2608f024a0eb520b` lost a Codex worker that
froze at 244s. A stdin nudge at 90s could have unblocked it without killing.

---

### F-8: Distinct error codes for process_killed — SHIPPED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** shipped — commit `e58c3a8`, session `acabe588`
**Location:** `internal/engine/loop.go`, `internal/types/types.go`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

`process_killed` is a generic status covering: frozen detection, OOM, startup
failure, and signal kill. GSD assumed OOM when the actual cause was frozen
detection (`frozen_tool_call` at 244s silence). Distinct codes
(`frozen_killed`, `oom_killed`, `startup_failed`, `signal_killed`) would
enable correct diagnosis without reading logs. Mechanical fix.

---

### F-1: Per-command timeout / hanging bash detection — SHIPPED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** shipped as "long command detection" — commit `2fd7fda`, session `acabe588`
**Location:** `internal/engine/loop.go`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

Only a global silence watchdog exists. A legitimate 10-minute Rust build is
indistinguishable from a hung `curl`. Risk of false positive kills is too
high — "job done is holy." The watchdog must not kill agents running
legitimate long-running commands.

**Investigation needed:** Can we distinguish between "process is silent because
it's dead" vs "process is silent because `cargo build` takes 8 minutes"?
Options:
- Track `tool_start` → `tool_end` pairs — if a known-long command is running,
  extend the silence threshold automatically
- Check if the child process is still alive (waitpid/WNOHANG) before killing
- Classify commands: `cargo`, `make`, `nvcc`, `go build` get extended grace

**Effort:** ~40 lines in `loop.go`, but design decision on classification
approach needed first.

## P1 — Soon

### F-9: `--quiet` output mode — SHIPPED (superseded)
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** shipped — superseded by Streaming Protocol v2 Tier 1, session `current` (2026-03-29)

Superseded by Streaming Protocol v2 (3.2.0): silent stderr is now the default.
`--stream` opt-in restores full event streaming. The original `--quiet` proposal
is no longer needed — the default behavior is what `--quiet` would have been.

---

### S-2: ax-eval instrumentation — SHIPPED
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** shipped — 26 cases, gaal trace verification layer, session `current` (2026-03-29)
**Reference:** `_archive/SPEC-V2.md` — ax-eval section

Build a proper ax-eval testing framework using gpt-5.4-mini high as the
judge. Structured `ax_eval` behavioral events emitted during dispatch:
- `error_correction` — agent noticed and self-corrected an error.
- `tool_retry` — a tool call was retried after failure.
- `scope_reduction` — agent narrowed scope mid-task.

These events feed an evaluation pipeline for measuring dispatch quality.

**Shipped:** 26 cases (15 original + 11 new), gaal trace verification layer
confirms behavioral events are being emitted and indexed correctly.

---

### S-3: ax-eval CI tests (LLM-in-the-loop behavioral tests) — SHIPPED
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** shipped — CI.md guide written, session `current` (2026-03-29)
**Reference:** `_archive/SPEC-V2.md`

CI tests that run a live dispatch against a small fixture repo and validate
behavioral outcomes (files changed, commands run, self-correction events)
using gpt-5.4-mini high as judge. CI.md guide written covering fixture setup,
test invocation, and expected pass/fail criteria.

---

## P2 — Planned

### B-8: Pipeline result assembly returns empty response
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** open (experimental/deferred)
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-03-30)

Pipeline dispatches (`-P=name`) sometimes return an empty `response` in the
final `PipelineResult`. Individual step workers complete successfully and
produce output, but the pipeline result assembly fails to thread the final
step's response into the top-level result. This appears to be a race in
how step results are collected and merged.

**Impact:** Low — pipelines are experimental and GSD-Heavy manually
orchestrates rather than using the pipeline primitive. Deferred until pipeline
usage justifies investigation.

---

### F-3: Pipeline orchestration enhancements
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** open (core shipped in 3.0.0)
**Location:** `internal/pipeline/`
**Design:** `references/streaming-protocol-v2.md` § "Future: Pipeline Verification Gates" (branching context)
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

Core sequential pipelines + within-step fan-out shipped. **Advanced features
never built** (confirmed via code audit — zero fields for conditions,
branching, or fan-in in `PipelineStep`):

- **Conditional branching** — skip or reroute based on previous step status
- **Fan-in aggregation** — merge parallel fan-out results
- **Pipeline-level timeout** — ceiling on total wall-clock time

---

### F-10: Pipeline verification gates
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** open (park alongside F-3) — design documented
**Location:** `internal/pipeline/`
**Design:** `references/streaming-protocol-v2.md` § "Future: Pipeline Verification Gates"
**Decided:** `current` (2026-03-29)

Field analysis of GSD-Heavy usage reveals a structural gap in pipelines: they
are useful for fire-and-forget known sequences but **cannot handle mid-flight
judgment**. The `build` pipeline exists but GSD-Heavy — the most sophisticated
user — does not use it. It manually orchestrates because pipelines lack
verification gates between steps (e.g., `cargo build --release` must succeed
before the next lifter wave launches). The highest actual pipeline value is
`tenx` fan-out.

**Root cause:** there is no mechanism to assert that a prior step's side effects
are correct before proceeding. Adding another LLM auditor step is not the
answer — it's slow, expensive, and introduces hallucination risk.

**Proposed:** executable verification gates between pipeline steps — a shell
command that must exit 0 for the step to be considered complete. If the gate
fails, the pipeline halts with a descriptive error. This is deterministic,
fast, and closes the gap that forces GSD-Heavy into manual orchestration.

**Relation to F-3:** conditional branching (F-3) and verification gates (F-10)
are complementary — gates catch failures, branching handles them. Both park at
P2 until pipeline usage justifies the investment.

---

### S-1: `repeat_escalation` liveness
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** open — not implemented, design documented
**Reference:** `_archive/SPEC-V2.md`
**Design:** `references/streaming-protocol-v2.md` § "Future: Repeat Escalation Liveness"
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

**Not implemented** (confirmed: zero matches for `repeat_escalation`,
`frozen_escalation`, or `escalat` in codebase). The watchdog has a
warn-then-kill two-stage reaction but no repeat-escalation logic. Related to
F-6 (soft steering) — both touch the liveness system.

---

### F-12: `gc --dry-run` structured output
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** open
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-03-30) — under discussion, may park if no real usage demand emerges.

`gc --dry-run` currently prints human-readable text. Machine consumers need
structured JSON output (list of paths that would be deleted + size recovered)
to build safe cleanup UIs or integrate with other tooling.

---

## P3 — Parked

### L-1: `response_max_chars` / truncation
**Type:** limitation | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked — truncation removed by design
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29) — truncation deleted in commit `51dbb23`. `coordinator` (2026-03-30) — confirmed not a priority.

Truncation is destructive and has been removed entirely. The `response_max_chars`
config field and related truncation logic no longer exist in the codebase.
The ax-eval `response-truncation` case (see S-4) should assert absence of
truncation, not presence. No further work on truncation as a feature.

---

### B-1: Gemini response capture broken
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked
**Location:** `internal/engine/adapter/gemini.go`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29) — "P3, we will do it when adding gemini.
For now we work on codex and claude code engines mostly."

Gemini dispatches return truncated or empty responses. NDJSON parser drops
content. Fix when Gemini becomes a primary engine.

---

### B-2: Hooks — needs rethink and re-implementation
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked (disabled in production)
**Location:** `internal/hooks/`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29) — "Hooks are P3, feature we need to
rethink and re-implement."

False positives on workspace reads. Entire hooks system needs redesign with
proper event source scoping before re-enabling.

---

### F-4: Bundled agent auto-install / setup command
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

---

### F-5: Session-local daemon / JSON-RPC control plane
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

---

## Closed

### F-2: `--no-truncate` hard-disable flag — CLOSED
**Status:** closed — truncation removed entirely in P0-1 (`51dbb23`)
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

---

### B-3: freeze-stdin-nudge test flakiness — FIXED
**Type:** bug | **Status:** fixed, session `current` (2026-03-29)

freeze-stdin-nudge test was flaky due to non-deterministic prompt format and
fragile envelope parsing. Fixed: deterministic prompt construction + hardened
envelope parser. Now passes reliably.

---

### B-4: Gaal Codex session indexing — FIXED (misdiagnosis)
**Type:** bug | **Status:** fixed / closed — misdiagnosed, session `current` (2026-03-29)

Reported as "gaal does not index Codex sessions." Root cause was wrong: gaal
*does* index Codex sessions correctly. The bug was in the search result
parsing layer (incorrect field extraction from the index response). Parsing
fixed; no changes needed to the indexer itself.

---
