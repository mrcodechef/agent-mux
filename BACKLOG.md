## P0 — Next Up

### F-6: Soft steering via stdin before hard kill — SHIPPED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** shipped — commit `2fd7fda`, session `acabe588`
**Location:** `internal/engine/loop.go` (watchdog), adapters
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

Current liveness: warn at 90s (pure observation), hard kill at 180s. The 90s
gap is dead air — no steering attempt. This was the original design intent of
the LoopEngine architecture, but **stdin pipe was never implemented** — no
`StdinPipe`, no `io.Writer`, no `Write` call to the child process exists
anywhere in `loop.go` or adapters.

The current "recovery" path is inbox-based: write a file → watchdog polls →
kill and relaunch with `ResumeArgs`. This is restart, not steering.

**Implementation needed:**
1. Add `cmd.StdinPipe()` in `startRun` (`loop.go:322-352`)
2. At warn threshold (90s), write nudge to stdin
3. Codex-first: `"\n"` or continuation prompt (stdin-driven by design)
4. Claude/Gemini: lower feasibility, investigate later

**Observed impact:** GSD session `a2608f024a0eb520b` lost a Codex worker that
froze at 244s. A stdin nudge at 90s could have unblocked it without killing.

---

### F-8: Distinct error codes for process_killed — SHIPPED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** shipped — commit `e58c3a8`, session `acabe588`
**Location:** `internal/engine/loop.go`, `internal/types/types.go`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

`process_killed` is a generic status covering: frozen detection, OOM, startup
failure, and signal kill. GSD assumed OOM when the actual cause was frozen
detection (`frozen_tool_call` at 244s silence). Distinct codes
(`frozen_killed`, `oom_killed`, `startup_failed`, `signal_killed`) would
enable correct diagnosis without reading logs. Mechanical fix.

---

### F-1: Per-command timeout / hanging bash detection — SHIPPED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** shipped as "long command detection" — commit `2fd7fda`, session `acabe588`
**Location:** `internal/engine/loop.go`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

Only a global silence watchdog exists. A legitimate 10-minute Rust build is
indistinguishable from a hung `curl`. Risk of false positive kills is too
high — "job done is holy." The watchdog must not kill agents running
legitimate long-running commands.

**Investigation needed:** Can we distinguish between "process is silent because
it's dead" vs "process is silent because `cargo build` takes 8 minutes"?
Options:
- Track `tool_start` → `tool_end` pairs — if a known-long command is running,
  extend the silence threshold automatically
- Check if the child process is still alive (waitpid/WNOHANG) before killing
- Classify commands: `cargo`, `make`, `nvcc`, `go build` get extended grace

**Effort:** ~40 lines in `loop.go`, but design decision on classification
approach needed first.

## P1 — Soon

### F-9: `--quiet` output mode — SUPERSEDED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** superseded by Streaming Protocol v2 Tier 1
**Decided:** `CURRENT_SESSION` (2026-03-29) — superseded in session that shipped 3.2.0

Superseded by Streaming Protocol v2 (3.2.0): silent stderr is now the default.
`--stream` opt-in restores full event streaming. The original `--quiet` proposal
is no longer needed — the default behavior is what `--quiet` would have been.

---

### S-2: ax-eval instrumentation
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** partial — framework shipped commit `1c543dd`, session `acabe588`; full suite pending
**Reference:** `_archive/SPEC-V2.md` — ax-eval section
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

Build a proper ax-eval testing framework using gpt-5.4-mini high as the
judge. Structured `ax_eval` behavioral events emitted during dispatch:
- `error_correction` — agent noticed and self-corrected an error.
- `tool_retry` — a tool call was retried after failure.
- `scope_reduction` — agent narrowed scope mid-task.

These events feed an evaluation pipeline for measuring dispatch quality.

**Framework landed** in commit `1c543dd`. 3 of 12 cases smoke-tested:
`bad-engine`, `bad-model`, `complete-simple`. Full suite validation pending.

---

### S-3: ax-eval CI tests (LLM-in-the-loop behavioral tests)
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** open (blocked on S-2)
**Reference:** `_archive/SPEC-V2.md`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

CI tests that run a live dispatch against a small fixture repo and validate
behavioral outcomes (files changed, commands run, self-correction events)
using gpt-5.4-mini high as judge. Blocked on S-2 (ax-eval events must exist
before they can be asserted against).

---

## P2 — Planned

### F-3: Pipeline orchestration enhancements
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** open (core shipped in 3.0.0)
**Location:** `internal/pipeline/`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

Core sequential pipelines + within-step fan-out shipped. **Advanced features
never built** (confirmed via code audit — zero fields for conditions,
branching, or fan-in in `PipelineStep`):

- **Conditional branching** — skip or reroute based on previous step status
- **Fan-in aggregation** — merge parallel fan-out results
- **Pipeline-level timeout** — ceiling on total wall-clock time

---

### F-10: Pipeline verification gates
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** open (park alongside F-3) — design documented
**Location:** `internal/pipeline/`
**Design:** `references/streaming-protocol-v2.md` § "Future: Pipeline Verification Gates"
**Decided:** `CURRENT_SESSION` (2026-03-29)

Field analysis of GSD-Heavy usage reveals a structural gap in pipelines: they
are useful for fire-and-forget known sequences but **cannot handle mid-flight
judgment**. The `build` pipeline exists but GSD-Heavy — the most sophisticated
user — does not use it. It manually orchestrates because pipelines lack
verification gates between steps (e.g., `cargo build --release` must succeed
before the next lifter wave launches). The highest actual pipeline value is
`tenx` fan-out.

**Root cause:** there is no mechanism to assert that a prior step's side effects
are correct before proceeding. Adding another LLM auditor step is not the
answer — it's slow, expensive, and introduces hallucination risk.

**Proposed:** executable verification gates between pipeline steps — a shell
command that must exit 0 for the step to be considered complete. If the gate
fails, the pipeline halts with a descriptive error. This is deterministic,
fast, and closes the gap that forces GSD-Heavy into manual orchestration.

**Relation to F-3:** conditional branching (F-3) and verification gates (F-10)
are complementary — gates catch failures, branching handles them. Both park at
P2 until pipeline usage justifies the investment.

### S-1: `repeat_escalation` liveness
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** open — not implemented, design documented
**Reference:** `_archive/SPEC-V2.md`
**Design:** `references/streaming-protocol-v2.md` § "Future: Repeat Escalation Liveness"
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

**Not implemented** (confirmed: zero matches for `repeat_escalation`,
`frozen_escalation`, or `escalat` in codebase). The watchdog has a
warn-then-kill two-stage reaction but no repeat-escalation logic. Related to
F-6 (soft steering) — both touch the liveness system.

## P3 — Parked

### B-1: Gemini response capture broken
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked
**Location:** `internal/engine/adapter/gemini.go`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29) — "P3, we will do it when adding gemini.
For now we work on codex and claude code engines mostly."

Gemini dispatches return truncated or empty responses. NDJSON parser drops
content. Fix when Gemini becomes a primary engine.

---

### B-2: Hooks — needs rethink and re-implementation
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked (disabled in production)
**Location:** `internal/hooks/`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29) — "Hooks are P3, feature we need to
rethink and re-implement."

False positives on workspace reads. Entire hooks system needs redesign with
proper event source scoping before re-enabling.

---

### F-4: Bundled agent auto-install / setup command
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

---

### F-5: Session-local daemon / JSON-RPC control plane
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

---

## Closed

### F-2: `--no-truncate` hard-disable flag — CLOSED
**Status:** closed — truncation removed entirely in P0-1 (`51dbb23`)
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)
