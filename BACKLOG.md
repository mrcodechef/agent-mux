## Strategic Direction

*Added 2026-03-30*

### Engine Priority Order
1. **Codex** — current focus. Perfect the dispatch, ax-eval coverage, steering, all rough edges. The bar must be top-notch before moving on.
2. **Gemini** — next engine after Codex reaches quality gate.
3. **Other harnesses** — after Gemini parity.

### Post-Freeze Plan
After this cleanup session, agent-mux enters a **multi-week development freeze**. No new features, no polish.

First post-freeze activity (1-2 weeks out): **Dissect the Codex CLI SDK (TypeScript)** end-to-end. Goal: hunt for patterns, undocumented capabilities, and integration points that agent-mux could leverage. Deep reading, not building.

### Current Posture
Codex-first. Ship quality. Resist the infinite polish trap.

---

## P0 — Next Up

### B-5: Config path resolution bug (`--cwd` doesn't pick up fixture config) — FIXED
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** fixed — session `coordinator` (2026-03-30)
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-03-30)

`--cwd fixture/` doesn't pick up `.agent-mux/config.toml` from the fixture
directory. Config path resolution is anchored to the process working directory
rather than the `--cwd` value, so role/variant resolution silently falls back
to defaults (or fails) whenever a dispatch uses `--cwd` with a fixture that
has its own config.

**Root cause (dual):** (1) `configPaths()` did not absolutize relative `--cwd`
values before joining with `.agent-mux/config.toml`, so relative paths resolved
against process CWD. (2) The ax-eval `testdata/fixture/` seed directory was
missing the `.agent-mux/` config dir — `SetupFixtureDir()` copies testdata to a
temp dir, so the config was never present in test runs.

**Fix:** Absolutize cwd in `configPaths()` + copy `.agent-mux/` to `testdata/fixture/`.

---

### B-6: `host.pid` / `status.json` write-before-ack race — FIXED
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** fixed — session `coordinator` (2026-03-30)
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-03-30)

After `--async` emits its ack JSON to stdout, `host.pid` and `status.json`
are not yet written to disk. Consumers that immediately check the filesystem
after receiving the ack find nothing — no PID file, no status file.

**Root cause:** Both `os.WriteFile` (host.pid) and `WriteStatusJSON` (atomic
rename) did not fsync before proceeding. The write ordering was already correct
(files before ack), but OS buffering meant consumers could see the ack before
the files were durable on disk.

**Fix:** Added explicit `f.Sync()` to both `WriteStatusJSON` and `writeAndSync`
(new helper for host.pid). The ack is now guaranteed to follow durable writes.

---

### B-7: `result --json` missing terminal status field — FIXED
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** fixed — session `coordinator` (2026-03-30)
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-03-30)

`agent-mux result --json` output does not include a terminal status field
indicating whether the dispatch completed successfully, failed, or was killed.
Machine consumers (GSD agents, scripts) cannot distinguish outcomes without
parsing free-form log text.

**Fix:** Added `enrichResultStatus()` to both `runResultCommand` and `showResult`.
Derives `"status"` from store record > dispatch meta > status.json (priority
order). Adds `"kill_reason"` (frozen_killed, signal_killed, oom_killed,
startup_failed) for failed dispatches by scanning events.jsonl. Removed the
`t.Skip` workaround in `TestAsyncDispatchAndCollect`.

---

### S-4: 3 weak-assertion ax-eval cases
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** partially resolved
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-03-30); updated `coordinator` (2026-04-03)

Three ax-eval cases had inadequate assertions:

1. **`handoff-summary-extraction`** — scored 1.0 in latest run (2026-03-30).
   `handoff_summary` field is now present in the output contract and
   correctly extracted. **Likely resolved.**

2. **`variant-resolution`** — **REMOVED** (2026-04-03, Wave 5 / `07ea163`).
   Role variants have been removed from the codebase entirely. The case tested
   variant-based model switching which no longer exists. No replacement case
   planned — flat roles are the only dispatch model.

3. **`response-truncation`** — **DELETED** from cases_v2.go (2026-04-03).
   The case used `--response-max-chars=200` which no longer exists;
   truncation was removed by design in 3.1.0. The entire case has been
   removed. No replacement case planned at this time.

**Target:** remaining cases at score ≥ 0.7 after fixes.

---

### F-6: Soft steering via stdin before hard kill — SHIPPED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** shipped — commit `2fd7fda`, session `acabe588`
**Location:** `internal/engine/loop.go` (watchdog), adapters
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

Current liveness: warn at 90s (pure observation), hard kill at 180s. The 90s
gap is dead air — no steering attempt. This was the original design intent of
the LoopEngine architecture, but **stdin pipe was never implemented** — no
`StdinPipe`, no `io.Writer`, no `Write` call to the child process exists
anywhere in `loop.go` or adapters.

The current "recovery" path is inbox-based: write a file → watchdog polls →
kill and relaunch with `ResumeArgs`. This is restart, not steering.

**Implementation needed:**
1. Add `cmd.StdinPipe()` in `startRun` (`loop.go:322-352`)
2. At warn threshold (90s), write nudge to stdin
3. Codex-first: `"\n"` or continuation prompt (stdin-driven by design)
4. Claude/Gemini: lower feasibility, investigate later

**Observed impact:** GSD session `a2608f024a0eb520b` lost a Codex worker that
froze at 244s. A stdin nudge at 90s could have unblocked it without killing.

---

### F-8: Distinct error codes for process_killed — SHIPPED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** shipped — commit `e58c3a8`, session `acabe588`
**Location:** `internal/engine/loop.go`, `internal/types/types.go`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

`process_killed` is a generic status covering: frozen detection, OOM, startup
failure, and signal kill. GSD assumed OOM when the actual cause was frozen
detection (`frozen_tool_call` at 244s silence). Distinct codes
(`frozen_killed`, `oom_killed`, `startup_failed`, `signal_killed`) would
enable correct diagnosis without reading logs. Mechanical fix.

---

### F-1: Per-command timeout / hanging bash detection — SHIPPED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** shipped as "long command detection" — commit `2fd7fda`, session `acabe588`
**Location:** `internal/engine/loop.go`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

Only a global silence watchdog exists. A legitimate 10-minute Rust build is
indistinguishable from a hung `curl`. Risk of false positive kills is too
high — "job done is holy." The watchdog must not kill agents running
legitimate long-running commands.

**Investigation needed:** Can we distinguish between "process is silent because
it's dead" vs "process is silent because `cargo build` takes 8 minutes"?
Options:
- Track `tool_start` → `tool_end` pairs — if a known-long command is running,
  extend the silence threshold automatically
- Check if the child process is still alive (waitpid/WNOHANG) before killing
- Classify commands: `cargo`, `make`, `nvcc`, `go build` get extended grace

**Effort:** ~40 lines in `loop.go`, but design decision on classification
approach needed first.

---

### F-13: Session traceability and lookup normalization
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P0 | **Status:** open
**Decided:** `rollout-2026-04-03T11-12-57-019d5230-18fd-7a01-927a-3aceb81a153a` (2026-04-03)

`agent-mux` already captures the harness `session_id` inside the engine loop,
but durable surfaces stop at `dispatch_id`. The file-based persistence layer
writes `meta.json` and `result.json` under `~/.agent-mux/dispatches/<id>/`;
`session_id` is present in `result.json` (via `PersistentDispatchResult`) but
is only updated in `meta.json` lazily via `UpdatePersistentMetaSessionID`.
`trace_token` and `salt` have been removed entirely.

**Intent:**
- Guarantee `session_id` is surfaced in `status`, `inspect`, `list --json`,
  and `result --json` for all completed dispatches.
- Accept `session_id` prefix as a lookup key anywhere a dispatch ref is
  accepted (alongside the existing `dispatch_id` prefix match).
- No `salt` or `trace_token` lookup — those fields no longer exist.

**Behavior gate:** after worker start, `agent-mux status --json <dispatch_id>`
returns `session_id`, and the same `session_id` is visible via `inspect`,
`list --json`, and `result --json`.

---

## P1 — Soon

### F-9: `--quiet` output mode — SHIPPED (superseded)
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** shipped — superseded by Streaming Protocol v2 Tier 1, session `current` (2026-03-29)

Superseded by Streaming Protocol v2 (3.2.0): silent stderr is now the default.
`--stream` opt-in restores full event streaming. The original `--quiet` proposal
is no longer needed — the default behavior is what `--quiet` would have been.

---

### S-2: ax-eval instrumentation — SHIPPED
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** shipped — 26 cases, gaal trace verification layer, session `current` (2026-03-29)
**Reference:** `_archive/SPEC-V2.md` — ax-eval section

Build a proper ax-eval testing framework using gpt-5.4-mini high as the
judge. Structured `ax_eval` behavioral events emitted during dispatch:
- `error_correction` — agent noticed and self-corrected an error.
- `tool_retry` — a tool call was retried after failure.
- `scope_reduction` — agent narrowed scope mid-task.

These events feed an evaluation pipeline for measuring dispatch quality.

**Shipped:** 26 cases (15 original + 11 new), gaal trace verification layer
confirms behavioral events are being emitted and indexed correctly.

---

### S-3: ax-eval CI tests (LLM-in-the-loop behavioral tests) — SHIPPED
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** shipped — CI.md guide written, session `current` (2026-03-29)
**Reference:** `_archive/SPEC-V2.md`

CI tests that run a live dispatch against a small fixture repo and validate
behavioral outcomes (files changed, commands run, self-correction events)
using gpt-5.4-mini high as judge. CI.md guide written covering fixture setup,
test invocation, and expected pass/fail criteria.

---

### F-14: Bare `agent-mux` should show curated help, not dispatch semantics
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** open
**Decided:** `rollout-2026-04-03T11-12-57-019d5230-18fd-7a01-927a-3aceb81a153a` (2026-04-03)

Bare invocation currently falls into implicit dispatch mode and only later
fails on "missing prompt." That is backwards for a coordinator-facing CLI. A
zero-argument call should act like a front door, not a malformed dispatch.

**Intent:**
- Bare `agent-mux` and `agent-mux help` show a curated help menu instead of
  entering dispatch mode.
- Preserve `agent-mux <prompt>` shorthand for actual dispatches.

**Behavior gate:** `agent-mux` with no args exits `0`, emits structured help,
and creates no artifact dir or control record.

---

### B-9: `steer <dispatch_id> status` lives on the wrong command
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** open
**Decided:** `rollout-2026-04-03T11-12-57-019d5230-18fd-7a01-927a-3aceb81a153a` (2026-04-03)

`agent-mux steer <id> status` duplicates the existing `status` surface while
placing an observational read under a mutating verb. The syntax is awkward,
the mental model is wrong, and the docs now have two ways to ask the same
question.

**Intent:**
- Make `agent-mux status <id>` the canonical live-status command.
- Keep `agent-mux steer <id> status` only as a compatibility alias for one
  release, then remove it.

**Behavior gate:** docs, help, and examples use `agent-mux status <id>`; the
deprecated alias returns the same payload during the transition window.

---

### B-10: `-cwd` long flag eats `-stdin` as its string value
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P1 | **Status:** open
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-04-03)

Go's `flag` package treats any unrecognized token after a string flag as its
value. When flags are ordered `-cwd /path -stdin`, the parser correctly assigns
`/path` to `-cwd` — but if the path is omitted or the user writes
`-cwd /path -stdin` and the space-separated value resolution rolls over, the
flag package greedily consumes `-stdin` as the string value for `-cwd`. Result:
`cwd` is set to `"-stdin"`, the boolean `-stdin` is never set, and the dispatch
spec is silently corrupted. The single-character shorthand `-C /path` is
unaffected because `flag` handles single-char flags differently.

**Reproduction:**
```
echo '{"prompt":"test"}' | agent-mux -E codex -cwd /some/path -stdin
# preview shows "cwd":"-stdin" and prompt becomes the path
```

**Impact:** Any programmatic caller using `-cwd` before `-stdin` silently
receives a wrong cwd and an empty/wrong prompt. The dispatch proceeds — there
is no error — so callers have no signal that anything went wrong. Breaking for
all coordinator-driven Codex dispatches that use `-cwd` with `-stdin`.

**Fix direction:** Switch the long-form cwd flag to `--cwd` (double-dash) via
a POSIX-compliant flag library (e.g. `pflag`), or enforce flag ordering
convention so `-stdin` always precedes positional/path flags, or document and
enforce `--` separator usage. The cleanest fix is `pflag` with `--cwd` long
form and `-C` short form, matching the existing shorthand and eliminating the
ambiguity entirely.

## P2 — Planned

### B-8: Pipeline result assembly returns empty response — REMOVED
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** REMOVED — pipeline system stripped
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-04-03)

Pipeline system has been removed entirely from the codebase. `internal/pipeline/`
no longer exists. This bug is no longer applicable. GSD coordinators perform
multi-step orchestration by chaining individual dispatches manually.

---

### F-3: Pipeline orchestration enhancements — REMOVED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** REMOVED — pipeline system stripped
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-04-03)

Pipeline system has been removed entirely from the codebase. `internal/pipeline/`
no longer exists. Conditional branching, fan-in, and pipeline-level timeouts
are not applicable. Multi-step orchestration is the coordinator's responsibility
via chained individual dispatches.

---

### F-10: Pipeline verification gates — REMOVED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** REMOVED — pipeline system stripped
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-04-03)

Pipeline system has been removed entirely. Verification gates between pipeline
steps are moot. If executable verification between dispatch steps is desired,
it is the coordinator's responsibility to check results before issuing the
next dispatch.

---

### S-1: `repeat_escalation` liveness
**Type:** spec gap | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** open — not implemented, design documented
**Reference:** `_archive/SPEC-V2.md`
**Design:** `references/streaming-protocol-v2.md` § "Future: Repeat Escalation Liveness"
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

**Not implemented** (confirmed: zero matches for `repeat_escalation`,
`frozen_escalation`, or `escalat` in codebase). The watchdog has a
warn-then-kill two-stage reaction but no repeat-escalation logic. Related to
F-6 (soft steering) — both touch the liveness system.

---

### F-12: `gc --dry-run` structured output — REMOVED
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** REMOVED — gc subcommand stripped
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-04-03)

The `gc` subcommand has been removed from the codebase. Structured dry-run
output is no longer applicable. Dispatch cleanup, if needed, must be done
by manually removing entries from `~/.agent-mux/dispatches/`.

---

### F-15: Multi-ID status endpoint for batched downstream queries
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P2 | **Status:** open
**Decided:** `coordinator` (2026-04-16)

Downstream consumers (notably `agent-tickets`) sometimes need status for
several dispatch IDs in one shot. Current surface forces a trade-off:

- `agent-mux status <id> --json` — per-ID fork. N dispatches = N subprocess
  spawns. Killed P-cores on the tickets side until the caller stopped
  polling terminal cards every 30s.
- `agent-mux list --json` — returns everything. Wasteful when the caller
  only needs a handful of known IDs.

**Proposed surface:** `agent-mux status --ids id1,id2,id3 --json` — one fork,
returns an array keyed by ID, same per-entry schema as current
`status --json`. Missing IDs reported explicitly (not silent omission).

**Why P2, not P1:** agent-tickets ships a local fix first (2026-04-16 batch:
deletes the backfill loop that triggered the need, carves `tokens` out of
the card schema). That removes the hot path. But the API-ergonomics issue
is real for future downstream consumers that legitimately need per-ID status
for many IDs — they'll hit the same fork-storm shape. Logging here so it's
not rediscovered from scratch.

**Context:** agent-tickets `reconcile.go` used to call `agent-mux status <id>`
for every terminal card with missing `tokens`/`session_id` frontmatter — 293
forks per 30s tick, each burning ~40% of one P-core. Root cause was schema
drift (tickets read `in`/`out`, agent-mux emits `input`/`output`) plus the
field never being emitted on `status` at all — so the tickets-side fix is
correct. This backlog item covers the residual API shape question only.

---

## P3 — Parked

### L-1: `response_max_chars` / truncation
**Type:** limitation | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked — truncation removed by design
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29) — truncation deleted in commit `51dbb23`. `coordinator` (2026-03-30) — confirmed not a priority.

Truncation is destructive and has been removed entirely. The `response_max_chars`
config field and related truncation logic no longer exist in the codebase.
The ax-eval `response-truncation` case (see S-4) should assert absence of
truncation, not presence. No further work on truncation as a feature.

---

### B-1: Gemini response capture broken
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked
**Location:** `internal/engine/adapter/gemini.go`
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29) — "P3, we will do it when adding gemini.
For now we work on codex and claude code engines mostly."

Gemini dispatches return truncated or empty responses. NDJSON parser drops
content. Fix when Gemini becomes a primary engine.

---

### B-2: Hooks — redesigned as executable scripts (Wave 4)
**Type:** bug | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** redesigned — Wave 4 (`dfde796`, 2026-04-03)
**Location:** `scripts/` (was `internal/hooks/`)
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29) — original parked; redesigned Wave 4 (`dfde796`, 2026-04-03)

Pattern-matching hooks with false positives on workspace reads have been replaced
by executable script hooks. Scripts receive env vars + JSON stdin; exit 0=allow,
1=block, 2=warn. Default hook: `scripts/block-dangerous.sh`. The old
`internal/hooks/` pattern-match engine is gone. If additional hook scripts are
needed, add them to `scripts/` using the new interface.

---

### F-4: Bundled agent auto-install / setup command
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

---

### F-5: Session-local daemon / JSON-RPC control plane
**Type:** feature | **Priority:** P3 | **Status:** parked
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

---

## Closed

### F-2: `--no-truncate` hard-disable flag — CLOSED
**Status:** closed — truncation removed entirely in P0-1 (`51dbb23`)
**Decided:** `acabe588` (2026-03-29)

---

### B-3: freeze-stdin-nudge test flakiness — FIXED
**Type:** bug | **Status:** fixed, session `current` (2026-03-29)

freeze-stdin-nudge test was flaky due to non-deterministic prompt format and
fragile envelope parsing. Fixed: deterministic prompt construction + hardened
envelope parser. Now passes reliably.

---

### B-4: Gaal Codex session indexing — FIXED (misdiagnosis)
**Type:** bug | **Status:** fixed / closed — misdiagnosed, session `current` (2026-03-29)

Reported as "gaal does not index Codex sessions." Root cause was wrong: gaal
*does* index Codex sessions correctly. The bug was in the search result
parsing layer (incorrect field extraction from the index response). Parsing
fixed; no changes needed to the indexer itself.

---
